* Kitchen: https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/installing/

## Validate the Packer config
* Set the correct token in the variable VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN 
* Make sure you have access to the "box_tag"  image in Vagrant Cloud.
```
$ export VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN="....."
$ packer validate nginx64.json
```
