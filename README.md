# packer-ubuntu-nginx
This repository has the Packer and Vagrant files to create a Virtualbox image that run Nginx under Ubuntu 18 and test it with Kitchen

# Validate the Packer config
* Set the correct token in the variable VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN 
* Make sure you have access to the "box_tag"  image in Vagrant Cloud.
```
$ export VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN="....."
$ packer validate nginx64.json
```

# Create the Virtualbox image

```
$ packer build -force nginx64.json
```

# Test that Nginx is installed
* Initialize kitchen
```
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```
* Check the output of the list to see if its in status converged
```
$ bundle exec kitchen list
```
* Run the tests
```
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```
